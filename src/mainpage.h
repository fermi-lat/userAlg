/*! @mainpage  package userAlg

This package is a "user hook" allowing development of algrorithms in the Glast Gaudi environment
Since it "uses" the global package pdrApp, it depends on all packages needed to build the 
simulation/ reconstruction environment. This includes 

  <ul>
<li> access to all quantities in the Transient Data Store (TDS)</li>
<li> writing text output to the log file (which can be turned on/off with the gui "printer").
<li> generating histograms and tuples, which would then be written to a ROOT file. (Need to document this.)
<li> ability to add components to the display, via GuiSvc.
</ul>
  The primary component (which can be easily added to) is UserAlg.
